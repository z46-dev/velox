# Macros
- ::prev
- ::slef (0xABCD -> 0xDCBA | 0xDBCA | ABDC | ...)
    - Take the hex representation of it and split each digit and swap them around randomly
    - Just like slef has every letter of self, it simply garbles them
    - This only exists to be funny

# Funny
- bool = `true | false | maybe`
    - Maybe gets replaced by 1 or 0 at runtime based randomly on a random maybe generator
    - if you do an if statement on a maybe but neither side has a print statement, it should run both sides of the if like a double slit experiment (Sawyer)
- Networking
    - Register hosts
    - Stateful
- Pass --no-maybe to disable:
    - Random compiler errors that don't exist
    - Spits output in random place on drive
- Optional stylistic choice of reversing order
    - If you do this you must end your program with the keyword "oops" and hold to it the entire program
